      Testimony: '"TENSOR began as a shared vision among the few passionate individuals during our final year at thapathali campus. We saw the need for a community that should work in favor of bridging the gap between academic knowledge and the real-world tech applications especially after how the landscape changed after the COVID-19 pandemic. What started as a small initiative has now grown into a thriving platform for the aspiring data scientists, developers and innovators. As the founding secretary, I take immense pride in how this community has evolved empowering students through the workshops, tech expos and collaborative learning. It is fulfilling to know that our efforts laid a foundation that continues to inspire and elevate the tech culture on campus. I believe the spirit of TENSOR will keep growing stronger with every new batch that joins this journey."',

      Testimony: '"I feel fortunate to be one of early member of TENSOR. Our early vision was to bridge gap between academic and industry across multiple domains. As we recognized the transformative potential of AI, we made a decision to narrowing our focus and make TENSOR only centered about AI. We also introduced new specialized AI research roles, for research opportunities and diving deep into core areas of AI. We had a vision to make TENSOR center of AI excellence on campus. Such that, whenever AI is discussed, TENSOR is the first thing that comes to mind."',
